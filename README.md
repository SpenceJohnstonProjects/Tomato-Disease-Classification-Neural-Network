# Tomato Disease Classification Neural Network
<br>
This Neural network was trained on the plant leaf disease dataset found at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1
<br>
<br>
This project manipulates the dataset, preprocesses the images in the dataset, configures the neural network, then trains the neural network.
